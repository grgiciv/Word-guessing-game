# Word guessing game
- Little project created for DOM manipulation practice
- Words are fetched from external API called [Random word API](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home)
- 3 levels of difficulty based on word length
- 100 random words are fetched from API and separated in 3 arrays based on their length
- Used letters are marked with different colors:
  - _green_: word contains selected letter
  - _red_: word does not contain selected letter
